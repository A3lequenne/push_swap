# Push Swap & Checker Programs Overview

This README provides an explanation of the **push_swap** and **checker** programs. These two programs work together to solve the **sorting stack** problem using a series of operations. The **push_swap** program is used to generate the sequence of operations, and the **checker** program verifies if those operations sorted the stack correctly.

## Push Swap Program

The **push_swap** program takes a list of integers as input and provides a sequence of commands to sort them. The commands are optimized to minimize the number of moves required to sort the list. The program generates commands such as `sa`, `pb`, `ra`, etc., which are used to move numbers between two stacks (stack A and stack B).

The key features include:
- **Handling various input sizes:** The program can handle lists of integers with different sizes (small, medium, or large) and selects the appropriate strategy accordingly.
- **Optimal moves calculation:** The algorithm is designed to minimize the number of operations required to sort the list.
- **Operations used in sorting:** The program uses stack operations such as `sa`, `sb`, `ss` (swap elements), `pa`, `pb` (push elements from one stack to another), and `ra`, `rb`, `rra`, `rrb` (rotate and reverse rotate).

The **push_swap** program uses a **combination of insertion sort and a greedy algorithm** to efficiently determine the sequence of operations needed to sort the input list. Specifically, for lists of 5 or fewer elements, an insertion sort-like approach is used, while for larger lists, a greedy algorithm is employed to determine the optimal series of moves.

### How to Use Push Swap

To run the **push_swap** program, you can use the following command:

```sh
./push_swap 5 3 2 1 4
```

The program will output a series of commands that can be used to sort the input values.

## Checker Program

The **checker** program is used to verify if a sequence of operations sorts a given list of integers correctly. It reads the sequence of commands generated by **push_swap** and checks whether the input list is sorted after executing those commands.

The key features include:
- **Input validation:** The program checks for errors in the input, such as duplicate values or invalid commands.
- **Command execution:** It processes commands (`sa`, `pb`, `ra`, etc.) to manipulate two stacks (stack A and stack B) and checks if the resulting stack A is sorted in ascending order.
- **Error handling:** If any invalid command is found or if the list is not sorted at the end, it prints an error message or `KO`.

### How to Use Checker

To run the **checker** program, you can provide a list of numbers and pipe the output of **push_swap** into **checker** like this:

```sh
ARG="5 3 2 1 4"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

- If the list is sorted correctly, the program will output:
  ```
  OK
  ```
- If the list is not sorted or an error occurred during processing, the program will output:
  ```
  KO
  ```
  or an error message if the input or commands are invalid.

Alternatively, you can use **checker** by providing a list of arguments and entering the commands manually. After entering the commands (pressing Enter between each), press `Ctrl + D` to stop the input:

```sh
./checker "5 3 2 1 4"
```

## Available Operations

Both programs use the following stack operations:
- **sa** / **sb**: Swap the first two elements of stack A or B.
- **ss**: Swap the first two elements of both stacks.
- **pa** / **pb**: Push the top element from stack B to A or from A to B.
- **ra** / **rb**: Rotate stack A or B upwards.
- **rra** / **rrb**: Rotate stack A or B downwards.
- **rr** / **rrr**: Rotate both stacks upwards or downwards.
