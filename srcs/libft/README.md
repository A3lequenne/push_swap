# My Libft Project

This repository contains a custom implementation of a C library (`libft`) providing a wide range of utility functions. It is organized into three main parts:

## Project Structure

1. **Base Library** (`base_lib`)
   - A collection of re-implemented standard C functions and additional utility functions, focusing on memory management, string handling, character checks, linked lists, and more.
   - [Go to Base Library](./base_lib/)

2. **Printf** (`ft_printf`)
   - A custom implementation of the `printf` function, providing formatted output capabilities similar to the standard library.
   - [Go to Printf](./ft_printf/)

3. **Get Next Line** (`get_next_line`)
   - A function to read from file descriptors line by line, ideal for reading text input or files.
   - [Go to Get Next Line](./get_next_line/)
